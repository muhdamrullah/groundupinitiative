	<h2>Balik Kampung Registration</h2>
		<p><b>Ground-Up Initiative</b> is a Singapore 21st Century 'School of Life' in a nature-inspired campus to forge A Beautiful Connection with the Earth and Community through Farming Your Heart.</p>
		<p><b>Balik Kampung</b> (meaning ‘going home’ in the Malay language) happens on <u>Saturdays</u> and is our flagship community programme. It helps us to renew our connection with the land and one another through a variety of tasks that helps upkeep the Kampung Kampus – GUI's community campus located in Yishun which is currently being built up by volunteers from all walks of life.</p>
		<p>These activities on the land revolve around the themes of <b>Community Building</b>, <b>Sustainable Living</b> and being a <b>Positive Change</b> in our society.</p>
		<p>We work on the land together through farming, cooking and housekeeping to build up and maintain the space. More importantly, we want to encourage more <b>mindfulness</b> in our urban lifestyle.</p>

	<h2>Activity Calendar</h2>

<!--<p>Farming is all about being connected with the ground and with nature. We plant herbs, we expose ourselves to the&nbsp;medicinal wonders of plants, we look after our terrace of amazing greens and we become so close to the land that we&nbsp;smell of earth. Through that, we maintain a sense of groundedness and humility, farming the land to grow as well as&nbsp;ourselves to cultivate our hearts and our minds.</p>
